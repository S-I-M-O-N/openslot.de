Issues/Findings/ToDo

openslot-1.8 only works with a 18V power supply. On 14,8V it immediatly triggers the short circuit detection.
There seems to be a redundant input signal for the rail status which is not used by the openslot.de firmware.
Maybe Carrera had some sort of Voltage detection and different I/O for 14,8V and 18V.



Thanks a lot to the great folks at www.openslot.de who gave us this awesome firmware to play around with.
