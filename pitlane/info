Original firmware:
- acts as a simple single switch
- Adds 150µS low phase to each controller / ghostcar packet

New Firmware:
- acts as single switch
- acts as car time sensor on both lanes
- send "car entered / leaved pitlane" through ResponseWire to CU

Future plan:
Configurable via serial interface on CU:
    - Adds 150µS low phase to each controller / ghostcar packet
      so "normal" refueling works
